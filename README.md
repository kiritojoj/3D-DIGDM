# A Discrete Index Graph Diffusion Model for 3D Meshes Synthesis #

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dcee7e2-5c11-4bf4-8bbc-0094f6715fab

## Preparing the Data ##

1. ShapeNet
Downloading the ShapeNetCore.v1 following the instruction of https://www.shapenet.org/account/.

2. BuildingNet
The BuildingNet dataset can be downloaded here: [BuildingNet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevg7fWWMYYMd1vaOdDloUX_55VOQK7PqS1DlniFV7_vuoI0w/viewform).

3.Use `preprocess/process_one_mesh.py` to convert meshes to T-SDFs with a threshold of 0.2 and resolution of $$64^{3}$$.

## Training and Inference ##

comming soon ...
